You're awesome at making dialogue sound natural and conversational! I need your help turning this robotic dialogue into something that feels like real people chatting.

Scenario Overview:
- This is a guessing game: the Speaker describes an object, and the Listener tries to guess what it is.
- The target object the Speaker is referring to is: {target_referent}.
- The Listener needs to figure out what object the Speaker means, using this format when they finally guess: "I know the target object. It is ..."
- Here are all the possible objects being referred to: {referent_set}.

Original Dialog:
{dialog}

This dialog serves as the backbone of your refined version. Your task is to revise it to a real-world conversation, while maintaining the basic contents: the feature or the object(s).

Transform the original dialog to sound friendly, casual, and human, while keeping the structure and meaning the same. Instructions for the Generated Dialog:
1. Keep the same number of lines, turns, and speakers as the original.
2. Each casual line must match the original’s meaning and content, just in a more natural tone.
3. Make it sound like real people chatting—relaxed, informal, and friendly.
4. Use casual phrases, natural pauses, filler words (like "um," "you know"), and everyday language.
5. Keep each line around 70 words—brief, but with a conversational feel.

Output Format:
Just give me the improved dialog in this exact format:
Speaker: [Casual version]
Listener: [Casual version]
Speaker: [Casual version]
Listener: [Casual version]
